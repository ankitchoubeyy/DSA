## Complexity
1. **Big(O)**: Worst case
2. **Omega(Ω)**: Best case
3. **Theta(θ)**: Average case

*Note:* We usually compare algo with worst case.

**Complexities order**: `1` < `logn` < `n` < `nlogn` < `n^2` < `n^3` < `2^n` < `n!`

e.g: O(n), O(logn), etc.

### Time Complexity 
- Total time taken by an algorithm to run.

### Space Complexity 
- Total space taken by an algorithm to run.

## Sorting
Arranging the items in particular order is know as sorting.

### Types of Sorting
1. Selection Sort
2. Bubble sort
3. Merge sort
4. Heap sort
5. Insertion sort
6. Quick sort
